The goal of this set of events is to introduce the BICCN human ex vivo MRI and 
microscopy datasets, involve the relevant communities to develop and explore 
scientific ideas, create tooling around these and future datasets to make it 
easy, and plan towards development of an online, digital, cellular atlas and 
knowledge base of the human brain. Please feel free to comment on this community
